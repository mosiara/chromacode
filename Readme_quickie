# ChromaCode™

*Where color is code and image is logic.*

**Visual-first layout language that transforms images into interactive, exportable code while preserving pixel-perfect integrity.**

*Built by Edna Nyangau ✨*

## ✨ What is ChromaCode?

Ever try making a UI layout from an image and watch your tools butcher it? ChromaCode treats **the image as sacred** and builds from it — not on top of it.

- 🧩 **Grid-based extraction** - Breaks your image into precise zones
- 🎨 **Hex color mapping** - Mathematical color extraction, no guesswork  
- 💻 **Export ready** - JSON for React/Vue/Unity + HTML/CSS for deployment
- 🧠 **Pure geometry** - Zero guesswork, mathematical precision

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosiara/chromacode.git
cd chromacode
# Open index.html in browser - no build needed!
```

**Live Demo**: [mosiara.github.io/chromacode](https://mosiara.github.io/chromacode/)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload** your PNG/JPG/WebP  
2. **Adjust** primary grid + subgrid overlay
3. **Export** `.chromacode.json` with hex-mapped zones
4. **Build** overlays like task lists, carousels, info panels
5. **Deploy** with any renderer or framework

---

## 📦 Export Modes

- **Interactive**: `.chromacode.json` with zone mapping for dynamic apps
- **Static**: HTML/CSS with grid overlays for immediate deployment
